# MyOwnHTTPserver


This practical work aims at programming an HTTP Server over TCP/IP. You will have to design and implement an
HTTP Server able to serve static HTML pages as well as dynamic requests that involve ricmlets. Ricmlets are very
closed to regular HTTP servlets, just a little bit simpler. Ricmlets provide clients with the ability to run Java code, server
side, following a well-defined API.
To be usable from any browser, your HTTP Server will follow the specifications of the HTTP protocol. However for
time reasons, we will only consider serving GET requests. As you all know, GET requests allow to get either static
pages or dynamic ones, as recalled below.
